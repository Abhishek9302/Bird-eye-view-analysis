# Player Tracking with YOLOv8 and DeepSORT
## 1. Project Overview
This project implements a real-time player detection and tracking system using state-of-the-art computer vision models. It processes video footage to identify individuals (players) and assign a unique tracking ID to each person, allowing for the analysis of their movements across frames.

This notebook is a practical demonstration of building a complete object tracking pipeline, which is a fundamental task in sports analytics, security surveillance, and traffic monitoring.

## 2. Core Technologies
The tracking system is built on a combination of powerful libraries and frameworks:

Object Detection: YOLOv8 (from Ultralytics) is used for its high accuracy and speed in detecting objects (in this case, people) within each video frame.

Object Tracking: DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) is employed to track the detected objects across different frames. It effectively handles situations where players are temporarily occluded or reappear in the scene.

Core Libraries:

PyTorch: The deep learning framework powering the YOLOv8 model.

OpenCV: Used for video processing tasks like reading and writing frames.

Supervision: A utility library that simplifies tasks like drawing bounding boxes, labels, and tracking lines.

NumPy & Pandas: For efficient numerical operations and data handling.

Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing results.

## 3. Setup and Installation
To run this project, you'll need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. A virtual environment is highly recommended.

Clone or download the project files.

Install the necessary packages using pip:

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support (adjust for your CUDA version if necessary)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118)

# Install the main computer vision and tracking libraries
pip install ultralytics deep-sort-realtime supervision -q

# Install other essential data science and image libraries
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib opencv-python pillow numpy pandas -q

## 4. How to Use the Notebook
Launch Jupyter: Open the player-tracking17 (3).ipynb file in a Jupyter environment like Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab.

Configure Input: Make sure the path to your input video file is correctly specified within the notebook.

Run the Cells: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially. The code will:

Load the pre-trained YOLOv8 model.

Initialize the DeepSORT tracker.

Open the input video file.

Loop through each frame, performing detection and tracking.

Generate an output video with bounding boxes and tracking IDs drawn on the detected players.

## 5. Potential Applications
This player tracking system can be adapted for various real-world scenarios, including:

Sports Analytics: Tracking player positions to analyze team formations, individual performance, and game strategy.

Retail Analytics: Monitoring customer flow and behavior within a store.

Security and Surveillance: Tracking individuals in restricted areas or monitoring crowds.

Traffic Management: Tracking vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians to analyze traffic patterns.
